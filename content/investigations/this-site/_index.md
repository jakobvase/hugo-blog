title: Setting up this website
---

I had some ideas for how I wanted to set up this website. This is my journal
documenting what I did, what worked, what didn't, what I learned, and how my
vision changed to reflect that learning.

I want:

- A blog, where I can write whatever I want.
- A journal of the current thing I'm working on - you're reading it!
- Books I've read, and my thoughts on them.
- Music I've heard, and my thoughts on it.
- Interesting things I've found.
- My music, written and recorded
- What you can hire me for
- Some way for people to subscribe to it all.
- Some way for people to comment on the stuff.
- What I have done myself, in programming, learning, and life.
- A now page (see [https://nownownow.com]) - done!

Other things I want:

- Email that lives on my domain, so you can contact me - done!
- To be able to run programs in different programming languages on the server,
  so I can have my own little army of webservices.
- I don't want to host the website myself. I believe it is silly to host your
  own stuff, when it's much better for the planet to focus that kind of thing
  elsewhere.
- I want to make sure that I can access my email and my passwords without
  anything else except for my phone number - in case I lose my phone and
  computer in a fire!

I want to use the following stuff:

- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for writing stuff.
- I want the website to be
  [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control.
- If I need a database, I'll probably use
  [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/).
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org) for communication between things, if
  applicable.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for formatting text and code.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) if
  applicable.
