I don't know much about hosting. I've built websites before using
[shared web hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service),
but this limits me to [PHP](https://www.php.net/), which I hate, or
[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) which is much too verbose
and silly for me. They also handle everything related to email, and I want to do
that myself So on to the great adventure of figuring this all out!

I currently live in Denmark, so I start out looking for
[VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) providers in my
vicinity.

- I find [Rackhosting](https://rackhosting.dk) to be very professional, but
  they're too expensive for me. If I ever need a really big server, I'll look
  here.
- I find [webdock](https://webdock.io) to hit the sweet spot, but there are so
  many options.

I could also delay the part of picking a hosting platform, and just start on my
own. That way, I can start writing now, and figure out the details later. This
is what I will do. I firmly believe in just getting started on _what I really
want to do_.

A final thought - I can also use docker to host my site on my own computer at
first. That way it should be easy to upload, once I figure it out.
