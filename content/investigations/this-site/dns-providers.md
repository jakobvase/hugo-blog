title: DNS providers

A week of work. Now back to the task at hand. I really like
[protonmail](https://proton.me/), because they are EU based (and they're not
lying), they really focus on privacy, and they have the option to use my own
domain.

As for my website, I have decided to go with a simple docker setup for now. I
want to compile these markdown files to html and serve them statically. I need
to figure out how to add a header and a footer as webcomponents, as that would
make it a lot easier to reuse, but I'll get there.

First though, the mail.

I think I have to find a DNS provider that will let me point my mail names to
protonmail, and my website to whatever provider I end up using. Currently, I'm
on [simply.com](https://simply.com), but I'm not satisfied, since I have to
write php, and I don't like their mail client.

Now to hunt some dns!

Oh no. Several things. Simply.com is apparently the highest rated dns provider
on trustpilot. Annoying. I wanted to use a company that _only_ provides dns.
Well. And then I realized that my website name is **boring**. There are almost
500 domain endings to choose from. I want another name for my website! There's
always some new thing in the way.

So for now I'll sleep on it. Maybe in the morning I will know what to call my
website. Maybe it doesn't matter so much. _I just really want to get it up and_
_running_. Because once again it is only a means to an end. I think I shall keep
[jakobvase.dk] for now. And keep simply.com as provider. For simplicity. But
we'll see tomorrow.
