I have decided I want my own website. This is my journal of that process.

I want it to have:

- A blog, where I can write whatever I want.
- A journal of the current thing I'm working on.
- Books I've read, and my thoughts on them.
- Music I've heard, and my thoughts on it.
- Interesting things I've found.
- Some way for people to subscribe to it all.
- Some way for people to comment on the stuff.
- What I have done myself, in music, programming, learning, and life.
- A now page (see [https://nownownow.com]).

Other things I want:

- Email that lives on my domain, so you can contact me.
- To be able to run programs in different programming languages on the server,
  so I can have my own little army of webservices.
- I don't want to host the website myself. I believe it is silly to host your
  own stuff, when it's much better for the planet to focus that kind of thing
  elsewhere.

I want to use the following stuff:

- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for writing stuff.
- I want the website to be
  [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control.
- If I need a database, I'll probably use
  [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/).
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org) for communication between things, if
  applicable.

I think that's enough for now. Welcome!
