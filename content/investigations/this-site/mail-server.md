title: Mail server

I want to have a mail server for emails on my domain. This is easy to set up
with
[shared web hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service),
but since I don't want to lock myself into PHP or C#, I want to go another
route.

After some looking, I discover this
[reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/avf4tl/container_for_email_server/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
Several apparently very experienced people discussing how they hate to manage a
mail server and never want to do it again. Oh well. I guess that means I'll look
into getting some big mail client to handle mails to my domain. Luckily, I don't
know anything about that either!

I know the big players are google and microsoft, but I would prefer someone
smaller. I take a look around, and I find several that look interesting, but I
actually quite like the google interface, and they are cheap enough. But then I
change my mind again and take an actual look at some other possibilities.

- [Hey email](https://www.hey.com/) seems quite nice and safe from big tech, but
  not a big focus on privacy.
- [Protonmail](https://proton.me/) very privacy focused - actually seems quite
  good. Will need a closer look.

As for hosting, I've found a few today too:

- [https://aiso.net/]
- [https://www.greengeeks.com/]
- [https://webhosting.coop/]
- [https://www.webarchitects.coop]

Leaning towards webhosting.coop, but still unsure.

Another option is a european cloud solution -
[this site](https://dataethics.eu/da/guide-to-european-cloud-solutions/) gives
some ideas, but again it's difficult to figure out. Also, would I benefit from
putting kubernetes in between, so I can change cloud provider later? One more
technology to learn.
