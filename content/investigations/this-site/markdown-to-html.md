title: Markdown to HTML
date: 2022-06-25

I want to write a tool that will convert my markdown to html. I know it has been
done before, by someone else, but I've wanted to write something in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for a long time, and I'm using a fairly
simple subset of markdown, so it should be easy to do, and it would teach me a
thing or two about rust.

I'll setup a new project and write that. The github is
[https://github.com/jakobvase/md-to-html].
