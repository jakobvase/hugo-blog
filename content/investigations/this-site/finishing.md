In the end, I backed down from some of my ideas. What use is a website if it's
not online? I ended up settling on https://gohugo.io as my blog engine, because
it reads markdown files and outputs a static blog. I'm hosting it on github
pages for now, because that was easy to set up and they are free.

The vase.art domain was premium, and I didn't want to pay _that_ much money, so
I'm now hosted at vase.dev.

I'll take a look at my initial goals and update this page soon. But for now, the
site is finally online.
