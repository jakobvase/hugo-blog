title: Split keyboards

Looking at options. I want a split, low profile, quiet, lightweight, preferably
wireless keyboard. Preferably without wrist supports. Preferably white/metallic,
because I like that look. Preferably not from the US or from China. Because
Trump and because Communism.

## Zsa Voyager

The one I thought of first. Split, low profile. Makes some sound. Not wireless.
678 g with travel case. $365. Canada based, Ontario. Nice company though. Made
in Taiwan. 2500 DKK. This is the one.

## Keeb Iris LM/CE

Can't get the case white? Durham, North Carolina.

## Dygma Defy

Wristpads stuck on it. 1 kg. $459. Split, not low profile, wireless. Spain. 3150
DKK.

## BastardKB Charybdis/Dilemma/Dactyls

€355-€530. I think. Doesn't say the weight. Includes a trackball for mouse,
which I think is really cool. The company also seems really nice. However, it's
not low profile, it's not wireless, there's no travel pack included...
Netherlands based. 4000 DKK. Or 2700 for the 35 keys. Or maybe actually 2200
DKK, since tax is different. But there's no travel pack included, the keycaps
are with numbers and letters etc and you can't pick ones without when you buy.
And it looks more technical than the sza. So I think I'll start with the sza.

## Glove80

2800 DKK. Wireless. Detachable palm rest. Split, low keys (choc), with travel
case. New Zealand based.

## Keebmaker Sofle

2400 DKK. Wireless. No palm rests. Split, low keys (choc). No travel case
included. Based in Sandy, UT, USA.
