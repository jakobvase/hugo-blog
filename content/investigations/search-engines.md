- Elastic Search / Open Search - uses something called Lucene under the hood.
  Powerful but hard. Free and open source. Can run in docker. Much Setup
  required.
- Algolia - search as a service. Expensive and seems less suited for filtering.
  Powerful. Faster than elastic. Cannot run in docker. Little setup required.
- Meilisearch - simpler?
- SOLR - Also uses Lucene.
- Typesense - simpler?
- lnx - small Rust thing. Fast? Not recommended
