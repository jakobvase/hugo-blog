I think I'm looking for something in the 120/144 hz refresh range. I don't need
superfast, but I know how much better it feels to work on something more than
60hz.

I also think I would like OLED over any other solution. Because the blacks are
nicer. And I like me some good blacks. What is the macbook display? The macbook
display is similar to something called "mini-led", in that it has 10.000 lights
behind the screen and these can turn on and off individually, creating almost
perfect blacks. But I want OLED.

I know I want at least QHD (2560x1440) resolution, but I probably want 4K. Don't
need 5k.

Don't want curved.

I want not the worst power consumption.

And I want something that is not made in China or the US.

So that's that.

I also want something in the 27-32" range.

Some options:

## Dell

5500 DKK, 144/360 hz, OLED, 26.7", QHD, ugly. It's not gonna be this one.

Then they have a 32" 4K QD-OLED, which is prettier:

7600 DKK, 240hz, OLED, 32", 4K, 44KWH, OK. But it's curved.

## Samsung

https://www.samsung.com/dk/monitors/gaming/odyssey-oled-g6-g61sd-27-inch-240hz-qhd-ls27dg612suxen/

6200 DKK, 240 hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 28KWH, nice. Doesn't have a great USB hub. But
I want 32" and 4K, so no.

https://www.samsung.com/dk/monitors/gaming/odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-32-inch-240hz-oled-uhd-ls32dg802suxen/

9990 DKK, 240hz, OLED, 32", 4K, 47KWH, nice. 250 nits. But it includes AI and I
don't want any of that.

https://www.samsung.com/dk/monitors/gaming/odyssey-oled-g6-g60sd-27-inch-360hz-oled-qhd-ls27dg602suxen/

7000 DKK, 360hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 31KHW, nice. But I want 32" and 4K, so no.

## LG

https://www.proshop.dk/Skaerm/27-LG-UltraGear-27GX790A-B-2560x1440-480Hz-OLED/3349226

8600 DKK, 480hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 25KWH, OK.

4700 DKK, 240hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 25KWH, ugly.

https://www.lg.com/dk/skaerme/ultragear-oled-gamerskaerme/32gs95ue-b/

https://www.proshop.dk/Skaerm/32-LG-UltraGear-32GS94UX-B-3840x2160-480Hz-OLED/3329758?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=02.%20Shopping%20-%20Alle&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=02.%20Shopping%20-%20Alle&utm_term=4576854596733929&utm_content=Ad%20group%20%231

9500 DKK, 480hz OLED, 32", 4K, 32KWH, OK. 240 nits

Or

https://www.proshop.dk/Skaerm/32-LG-UltraGear-32GS95UV-B-3840x2160-240Hz-OLED/3349490

9700 DKK, 240hz, OLED, 32", 4K, 32KWH, OK, 275 nits. This is actually a really
good one. I read some reviews, some experiences on Reddit, and I'm going with
this one. It also apparently uses less power than the other 32" OLED monitors
do, and LG has a lot of experience with screens.

## Asus

https://www.elgiganten.dk/product/computer-kontor/skarme-tilbehor/monitor/asus-rog-swift-pg27aqdp-27-oled-gaming-skarm/814927

8500 DKK, 480hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 25KWH, ugly.

## AOC/Xiaomi?

4300 DKK, 240hz, OLED, 27", QHD, 29KWH, OK.

## MSI

10000 DKK, 240hz, QD-OLED, 32", 4K, 44KWH, OK, 250 nits. This is also a really
great monitor. It's QD-OLED, which is really cool, but apparently still a little
immature, if I trust random reddit people. It apparently also had some problems
with color switching.

# Thinkings

People seem to say that Dell, Asus, and MSI are good. Don't hear as much about
LG or Samsung, apart from a few.
