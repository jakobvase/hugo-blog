title: I need better wi-fi, how should I do it?

I've come across https://wiisfi.com (thanks Ulrik!) before, and it's a mouthful,
but it's also amazing. I need better internet since I'm working more from home
and video calls are lagging.

## TL;DR

My TP-Link Archer C2 AC900 from 2015 is good enough for now. I've switched to
2.4g in my home office, which has better range, and everything is good.

## Current setup

I have a single TP-Link Archer C2 AC900 router centrally placed in my 125 m2
house.

I have a 1gb fiber connection.

## Things I need/would like

The router/access point needs to be pretty for my wife to accept it to be
hanging anywhere. And I want it to hang in the ceiling.

"Pretty" is an annoying term, but it has to be white, not too
electronic-looking, and only have a single cable running to it. So Power over
Ethernet is important.

I also prefer for the router to be EU-made, open source, modular, repairable,
etc. All the good tech things. And not from China if I can get it. Problem is
the access points can't be that, because modular things aren't pretty enough.

So more and more I'm looking at one to two pretty access points, and a nice
router.

### I've learned

I have basically two options. Buy a nice router (like the Fritzbox 5690 pro) for
approx. €400 and keep it in the cupboard. I don't really believe that's enough.

Otherwise buy two nice PoE powered access points, put one upstairs and one
downstairs, buy a PoE switch and do it that way. UniFy 6 Pro is approx. €200
each, a switch is about €100, cables are about €50. So €550, and I'm sure it
works. And I can upgrade the individual parts if I need to.

I'm going with option 2.

## Reservations

I have pre-fallen in love with the ubiquiti lineup. I've seen it work well at
work. But I shouldn't let it cloud my judgment. However, the guy from wiisfi
also mentions them as a good option. So there's three reasons why I'm thinking
to go that way before I even start. It worked at work. Wiisfi recommends it.
It's pretty. I think worst case is it might be overkill for my private home. But
I'm OK with a little overkill.

## Things to do before I buy

Try out how the wifi works in a lot of rooms with and without other devices on
it. I want to know that what I buy actually improves the throughput.

Current phy speed 293 Mbps. Now 433. I'm in the opposite direction from the
kids, they're playing 2 ipads and have 2 phones connected.

## Options

### Ubiquiti U7 Pro (Access Point)

- €165 + VAT
- 6-stream (what does that mean?)
- 2.4,5,6 ghz
- 2.5 Gb input, power over ethernet, requires PoE+
- Is pretty
- Mimo 2x2?

### Ubiquiti U6 Pro (Access Point)

- €150 + VAT
- Also 6-stream. Whatever that is
- 2.4,5 ghz
- 1 gb input, PoE+
- Pretty
- Mimo 4x4

### Ubiquiti Edge Router

This was the one they used at work.

### Cable from router (Low tech)

Requires a 20 M cable and a ethernet->usb-c converter. Is not as pretty. Doesn't
help the rest of the family.

- €32 for the adapter
- €30 for the cable

### Turris Omnia or Mox

Turris makes their routers and 'mox' in Czechia. It's all open source, but more
expensive than my other options. Mox is interesting, it's a modular device for
networking. The problem is that it's not pretty, and pretty expensive.

### FRITZ!Box

Dunno if they're any good or what they cost. Made in Germany apparently.
https://en.avm.de/products/fritzbox/. Will look later.

Actually seems OK. They have 4x4 MIMO which is apparently really important. I
might just go with this one, actually? It's €383.43 on amazon.de.

## Options for switches

## Shops

These are all local to Denmark, so may not be relevant for others.

- av-connection.dk - Seems professional. Total of 2.860 DKK for U7 Pro, USW Lite
  Switch and 3 cat-7 cables. Dunno if they are aluminium or full copper.
- danbit.dk - Also seems professional. At least for cables. 560 DKK for 3
  cables. 100% copper.
- dustin.dk - 2500 for U7 Pro & UniFi Ultra (dunno if that supports PoE+). No
  cables yet.
- proshop.dk - consumer. They have so much stuff. None of the cables are full
  copper.
- av-cables.dk - consumer. Sold out on access points, but cheaper on the rest,
  maybe?
- ui.com - ubiquiti's own store. Around €400 for access point, switch and
  cables. Dunno if the cables are full copper.
