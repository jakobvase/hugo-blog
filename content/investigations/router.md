title: I need better wi-fi, how should I do it?

I've come across https://wiisfi.com (thanks Ulrik!) before, and it's a mouthful,
but it's also amazing. I need better internet since I'm working more from home
and video calls are lagging.

## Current setup

I have a single TP-Link Archer C2 AC900 router centrally placed in my 125 m2
house.

I have a 1gb fiber connection.

## Restrictions

The router/access point needs to be pretty for my wife to accept it to be
hanging anywhere. And I want it to hang in the ceiling.

"Pretty" is an annoying term, but it has to be white, not too
electronic-looking, and only have a single cable running to it. So Power over
Ethernet is important.

## Reservations

I have pre-fallen in love with the ubiquiti lineup. I've seen it work well at
work. But I shouldn't let it cloud my judgment. However, the guy from wiisfi
also mentions them as a good option. So there's three reasons why I'm thinking
to go that way before I even start. It worked at work. Wiisfi recommends it.
It's pretty. I think worst case is it might be overkill for my private home. But
I'm OK with a little overkill.

## Things to do before I buy

Try out how the wifi works in a lot of rooms with and without other devices on
it. I want to know that what I buy actually improves the throughput.

## Options

### Ubiquiti U7 Pro (Access Point)

- €165 + VAT
- 6-stream (what does that mean?)
- 2.4,5,6 ghz
- 2.5 Gb input, power over ethernet, requires PoE+
- Is pretty
- Mimo 2x2?

### Ubiquiti U6 Pro (Access Point)

- €150 + VAT
- Also 6-stream. Whatever that is
- 2.4,5 ghz
- 1 gb input, PoE+
- Pretty
- Mimo 4x4

### Cable from router (Low tech)

Requires a 20 M cable and a ethernet->usb-c converter. Is not as pretty. Doesn't
help the rest of the family.

- €32 for the adapter
- €30 for the cable

## Options for switches

## Shops

These are all local to Denmark, so may not be relevant for others.

- av-connection.dk - Seems professional. Total of 2.860 DKK for U7 Pro, USW Lite
  Switch and 3 cat-7 cables. Dunno if they are aluminium or full copper.
- danbit.dk - Also seems professional. At least for cables. 560 DKK for 3
  cables. 100% copper.
- dustin.dk - 2500 for U7 Pro & UniFi Ultra (dunno if that supports PoE+). No
  cables yet.
- proshop.dk - consumer. They have so much stuff. None of the cables are full
  copper.
- av-cables.dk - consumer. Sold out on access points, but cheaper on the rest,
  maybe?
- ui.com - ubiquiti's own store. Around €400 for access point, switch and
  cables. Dunno if the cables are full copper.
