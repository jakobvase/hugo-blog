title: My religion is humankind

I don't give myself in service to Allah, God, or Jahve.

I give myself in service to us.

My life means nothing compared to our greatness.

To having lived a life fully in service of us, is the greatest achievement one
can make.

I will sacrifice myself for us. Sacrifice my family for us.

We are not perfect, all-knowing beings. We are faulty, we are messy, we know so
very little.

But we can read the stars. And maybe we can reach them. That is enough for me.

Join me, brothers, sisters, and others.
