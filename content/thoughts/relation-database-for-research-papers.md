Research papers contain references to data and/or other research papers. I’d
love a website linking all the research papers to each other in some graphically
beautiful way. Google Scholar probably already does this, but it’s so ugly…

So imagine if I search for ‘epistemology’. The search results could be in
chronological order (the first research paper mentioning epistemology followed
by all the others, the origin), rated order (maybe by most referenced, by expert
validations, by popular choice), some combination of the two (highest rated by
experts in the last 10 years).

And imagine if I check the paper with the first mention of epistemology. That
paper could then produce a tree showing all the papers referencing it and their
references (of course graphically beautiful) and all references the paper makes
and their references (chronological in both directions. The paper’s place in the
research tree.)

Does this already exist somewhere?
