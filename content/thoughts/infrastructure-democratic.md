title: Infrastructure should be democratic

When setting up my site and email, I encountered a problem. None of the hosting
providers or email providers I could find were democratic. I see (cloud) hosting
and email as core infrastructure of the internet, and it bugs me that I can't
influence the decisions of those that I run my most critical stuff on. I don't
trust companies like google or amazon with my private data, and I don't trust
smaller companies to stay in business.

I want a company where the customers are the stakeholders. I want a company
where the people using the infrastructure are the ones who make decisions on it.
I believe all infrastructure should work this way. Don't make a profit giving
people something they have to use.

Some do exist:

- https://webhosting.coop/
- https://www.webarchitects.coop

but they seem to require that you are yourself a coop in order to join, and that
was not what I wanted.
