Like, backups. Everyone knows how this can be done. Have automated scheduled
backups. Encrypt them. Send to offsite storage. This should be handled through a
generic backup protocol so you can choose your provider and be sure the app
doesn't siphon your personal data.

Users should not need to manually fuck around to set this up for every computer
and every app they use. This should be absolutely standard. Preferably built at
OS level. I know Ubuntu had something of this sort, but IIRC it wasn't based on
an open standard where you could choose your own storage provider. Windows? Hah.

Instead, developers strip users of all control over their data claiming it's for
their own good, and push everything to a myriad proprietary cloud solution
through random protocols with dubious security implications.
