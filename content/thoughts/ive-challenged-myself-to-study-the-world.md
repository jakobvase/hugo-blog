title: I’ve challenged myself to study the world

Today I watched the movie
[Captain Fantastic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3553976/). The name is
misleading – the movie is not about a superhero, but instead about a father and
his 6-7 children living in the woods and studying the world. It’s a funny movie,
but it also got me thinking.

Disclaimer: I’m Scandinavian, many of the ‘alternative’ methods the father uses
to raise his kids are common here. But his insistence on teaching and reflection
are inspiring, as is his insistence on caring for one’s body.

And I’m going to use this inspiration to start studying myself. I’ve decided to
start with sociology, by first reading the
[wikibook Introduction to Sociology](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Sociology),
as I have some ideas in that area. I’ll write something on those later. For now,
I’m going to link some nice inspiring stuff here:

- [The RSA animated videos](https://www.thersa.org/discover/videos/rsa-animate)
  – videos on a range of subjects, cutely animated and easy to follow. Great
  starting point.
- [The science subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/science) – Nothing gets you
  into a better mood than reading about people finding out cool new stuff all
  the time. Awesome.

Edit: I forgot to write why this is a challenge… It’s a challenge because I will
try to post my learnings and findings here every week. That and actually
learning something.
