# Hi

I'm Jakob Vase. I'm from 1987. I'm a developer, musician, husband, and father
of 3. I'm based in Denmark.

To see what I'm doing now, see my [now page](/now).

## Stuff to read

- I take it very seriously when I need to make a decision about something, and I
  write down the investigations I've done. If you need to make a similar
  decision, these might be useful. [Link](/investigations).
- I'm a developer, so I write about software development.
  [Link](/software-development).
- I've written a lot of thoughts about life and society over the years. Some of
  them I don't agree with anymore, but they might mean something to someone, so
  they are still there. [Link](/thoughts).
- A few random things I learned, mostly for myself. [Link](/til).

## Things I've done

- My band, [Songs for Iris](https://songsforiris.dk).
- [A score tracker for board games](https://score-tracker.vase.dev), currently
  private.
- My wife's [website](https://majavase.dk) and her
  [app](https://chocolat.dk/app-link).

## How to contact me

Coming soon.
