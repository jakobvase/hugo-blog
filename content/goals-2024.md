I could complete another video game. Feels empty.

I could join some open source. But I code enough.

I could fix some things on Majas site. But this is work, not something I enjoy.

I could publish this blog. That's a potential candidate.

I could write a song or ten. That's another potential candidate. And that's
something I really want to do.

I could punk SFI to get up. Maybe? I don't enjoy it at first, but I might later.

I could join a political party and work for that. Potential candidate.

I could write that messenger app. Or that identity service. Create a company for
small things that might become something. Feels too much like work too?

I could read a book. I do enjoy that. But not as much as music.

I could write a book. Makes more sense after I've published the blog.

I could make a board game. I don't think so. Would rather make something else.

Plan: Delete the fucking game. I don't need to ever complete it. Write SFI. We
should get something off the ground again. Make some music again.

Done.
